# About me

I am a Swiss Computer Science Student currently finishing my Master Thesis at [EPFL](https://epfl.ch) in Lausanne. 

I have taken courses about many subjects, but I'm mostly interested in Machine Learning, Data Analysis, Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision. I can code in Python, Java/Scala and C/C++, and I have some experience with a lot of libraries (Pytorch, transformers, keras, sklearn, spark, nltk, pandas, ...)

You can take a look at my [CV](http://bilat.xyz/cv), see a list of [Projects](http://bilat.xyz/projects) I worked on or take a look at my [Github page](https://github.com/Billotais).
