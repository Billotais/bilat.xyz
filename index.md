# My Projects

During my studies and my free time, I had the occasion to work on many programming projects. Here are a few of them :

### Detecting Bias in Amazon reviews

A Data Story about the potential bias that can be found in Amazon user reviews, and how to correct it. Done in Python, with various tools including Pandas, pyspark, and matplotlib. [Link](https://ada-lyn.github.io/)

### The Quest for The Holy Grail

Creation of a 3D maze game with different objectives, world physics, lightning effects, drawing optimisation. user interface and sound effects. Done in C with OpenGL. [Link](https://github.com/Billotais/TSBK07_project)

### Part-of-Speech Tagger and Dependency Parser

Implementation of a Part-of-speech tagger using a multi-class perceptron classifier (with an accuracy of more than 93%) and a sentence dependency parser (with an accuracy of more than 76%). Done in Python. [Link](https://github.com/Billotais/TDDE09_project) 

### Tankode

Creation of an educative video game where the behavior of a Tank had to be programmed by the user. This game was programmed in less than 48 hours using Android Studio, in a team of 4 people. I had the opportunity to learn how to work efficiently in a team by splitting the work in an optimal way.

### XBlast

Creation of a multiplayer video game based on the game Bomberman. It could be played by up to 4 player on different computers. Written in Java.

### Calcul mental

Creation of an Android app that people can use to do some small calculations (additions, substractions, multiplications and divisions). Different modes, such as a test mode, a timed mode and a rush mode are available. [Link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lafloculation.billotais.livrets)

### La Pipopipette

Creation of a multiplayer video game for iOS based on the game Dots and Boxes as my Maturity Project. An artificial Intelligence was implemented. Written in Objective-C. [Link](https://github.com/Billotais/billotais.github.io/raw/master/_data/TM.pdf)
